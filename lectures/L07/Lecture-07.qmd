therefore, want students how to fit a linear regression model and be able to interpret 
- Want to make sure we are using it for the right thing (linear relationship)
- want to make sure we are fitting it properly
- Want to then be able to interpret the output
--->

## Refresher from ENVX1002

- Regression modelling is for one *continuous numerical* response ($y$) and one or more *numerical* predictors ($x_1$, $x_2$, $x_n$)
- Can be for linear or nonlinear relationships -- focus on linear in ENVX2001
- To help us:
    + Understand the relationship between variables
    + Predict new values of $y$ based on $x$
    + Test hypotheses about the relationship between variables
- Fit a 'line of best fit' that minimises the sum of the squared residuals (least-squares)

## Workflow {auto-animate=true}

## Brief history {auto-animate="true"}

- **Method of least squares** first theorised by Adrien-Marie Legendre in 1805
- **Technique of least squares** first used by Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1809 (to fit a parabola to the orbit of the asteroid Ceres)
- **Model fitting** first published by Francis Galton in 1886 (predicting the height of a child from the height of the parents)

# Simple linear regression

## Defining a linear relationship {.nostretch}

- Pearson correlation coefficient ($r$) measures the linear correlation between two variables
- Useful for distinguishing *strength* (weak/moderate/strong) and *direction* (positive/negative) of the association
- Does not distinguish different *patterns* -- i.e. is the relationship actaully linear?

$$ r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2 \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \bar{y})^2}} $$

## Anscombe's quartet

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
library(tidyverse)
anscombe %>%

    names_to = c(".value", "set"), names_pattern = "(.)(.)") %>%

    geom_point(size = 3) +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
    facet_wrap(~set, ncol = 4)
```

*All of these data have a correlation coefficient of about 0.8, but **only one** of them meet the assumptions of a linear model.*

## Datasaurus Dozen

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
library(datasauRus)
ggplot(datasaurus_dozen, aes(x=x, y=y)) +
  geom_point(size = .5, alpha = .3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE) +
  facet_wrap(~dataset, ncol = 6)
```

*All of these data have the **same** correlation coefficient, mean and standard deviation but look very different.*

## Simple linear regression modelling {auto-animate="true"}

We want to predict a response $Y$ based on a predictor $x$ for $i$ number of observations: 

$$Y_i = \color{royalblue}{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i} +\color{red}{\epsilon_i}$$

where

$$\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$$

- $Y_i$, the *response*, is an observed value of the dependent variable.
- $\beta_0$, the *constant*, is the population intercept and is **fixed**.
- $\beta_1$ is the population *slope* parameter, and like $\beta_0$, is also **fixed**.
- $\epsilon_i$ is the error associated with predictions of $y_i$, and unlike $\beta_0$ or $\beta_1$, it is *not fixed*.

Because $\epsilon_i$ is the only part of the equation that is not fixed, we associate it with the **residual error** ($observed-predicted$). It would also cover other aspects of error (e.g. sampling error, parallax error) but these are hard to discern.

## Fitting the model {auto-animate="true"}

- The *residual* is the difference between the observed value of the response and the predicted value:

$$\hat\epsilon_i = y_i - \color{royalblue}{\hat{y}_i}$$

where $\color{royalblue}{\hat{y}_i}$ is the predicted value of $y_i$:

$$\color{royalblue}{\hat{y}_i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i$$

therefore:

$$\hat\epsilon_i = y_i - \color{royalblue}{(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i)}$$

- We use the **method of least squares** and minimise the sum of the squared residuals (SS):

$$\sum_{i=1}^n \hat\epsilon_i^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \color{royalblue}{(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i)})^2$$

## {auto-animate="true"}

Finding the minimum SS requires solving the following problem:

$$\color{firebrick}{argmin_{\beta_0, \beta_1}} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \color{royalblue}{(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i)})^2$$

We can find $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ analytically:

$$ \beta_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2} =  \frac{Cov(x,y)}{Var(x)} = \frac{SS_{xy}}{SS_{xx}} $$
then substituting $\beta_1$ into the equation for $\beta_0$:

$$ \beta_0 = \bar{y} - \beta_1 \bar{x} $$
## Numerical fitting

Computer uses “random guesses” to find set of parameters that minimises objective function (SS) -- more computationally efficient and applies beyond linear regression.

## Galton's data

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
library(HistData)
str(Galton)
```

- 928 children of 205 pairs of parents
- Average height of both parents and their child's height measured in inches
- Size classes were binned (hence data looks discrete)

*Galton, F. (1886). Regression Towards Mediocrity in Hereditary Stature Journal of the Anthropological Institute, 15, 246-263*

---

```{r}
ggplot(Galton, aes(x = parent, y = child)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .2, size = 3) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(subtitle = paste("Correlation:", round(cor(Galton$parent, Galton$child), 2)))
```

## Regression modelling in R with `lm()`

```{r}
#| echo: true
fit <- lm(child ~ parent, data = Galton)
```

<br> 

That's it - the model has been fitted.


<!-- ```{r}
library(report)
report(fit) 
```  -->

<br>

Does the input of `lm()` look familiar? It should!

```{r}
#| eval: false
model <- aov(y ~ x, data)
```


## Handle `lm()` output

Residuals and fitted values (amongst other things) can be obtained from the `lm()` object:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
fit$residuals
fit$fitted.values # i.e. predictions for our x values
```

We can view the model output using `summary()`, and then extract specific parts of the output using `$` notation:

```{r}
#| echo: true
summary(fit)
summary(fit)$r.squared
```

The `sjPlot::tab_model()` package is useful to create a formatted summary table:
```{r}
#| echo: true
library(sjPlot)
sjPlot::tab_model(fit, dv.labels = "")
```

---

The `broom::glance()` function is useful for quickly assessing model parameters:

```{r}
#| echo: true
broom::glance(fit)
```

The `broom::augment()` function adds residuals and fitted values to a data frame:

```{r}
#| echo: true
broom::augment(fit) |> head()
```

## Assumptions

The data **must** meet certain criteria, which we often call *assumptions*. They can be remembered using **LINE**:

- **L**inearity. The relationship between $y$ and $x$ is linear.
- **I**ndependence. The errors $\epsilon$ are independent.
- **N**ormal. The errors $\epsilon$ are normally distributed.
- **E**qual Variance. At each value of $x$, the variance of $y$ is the same i.e. homoskedasticity, or constant variance.

**Notice any similarities to the assumptions of ANOVA?**

:::{.callout-tip}
All but the independence assumption can be assessed using diagnostic plots. 
:::

## Assumptions with `plot()`

```{r}
#| echo: true
par(mfrow= c(2, 2))
plot(fit)
```

## Assumptions with `ggfortify package and autoplot()`

```{r}
#| echo: true
library(ggfortify)
autoplot(fit)
```

## Assumptions using `performance`

Also provides a guide on what to check for in the assumption plot.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
library(performance)
performance::check_model(fit) # check all assumptions
performance::check_model(fit, check = c("linearity", "qq", "homogeneity", "outliers")) # check specific assumptions
```

## Assumption: Linearity

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

Prior knowledge and visual inspection comes into play. Does the relationship look approximately linear?

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
ggplot(Galton, aes(x = parent, y = child)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .2, size = 3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

:::
:::{.column width="50%"}
The linearity assumption can be checked again by looking at a plot of the residuals against $x$ (i.e. `parent` height).

```{r}
#| echo: true
performance::check_model(fit, check = "linearity")
```

:::
::::

- Where the green reference line is > 0, the model *underestimates*, and where it is < 0, it *overestimates*.
- If the linearity assumption is **violated**, we should not be fitting a linear model -- transform or use a nonlinear model.

## Assumption: Independence

This assumption is addressed during experimental design, but issues like correlation between errors and patterns occurring due to time are possible if:

- Observations of the same subject are related i.e. [multicollinearity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity)
- Time-series data, if the same subjects are sampled i.e. [autocorrelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocorrelation)

## Assumption: Normality

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

For a given value of $x$, the residuals should be normally distributed. In a scatterplot of $x$ and $y$, the points would appear evenly distributed (linear and no fanning).

:::{.column width="50%"}

```{r}
performance::check_model(fit, check = c("normality", "qq"))
```

## Assessing normality using residuals

- **Light-tailed**: small variance in residuals, resulting in a narrow distribution
- **Heavy-tailed**: many extreme positive and negative residuals, resulting in a wide distribution
- **Left-skewed** (n shape): more data falls to the left of the mean
- **Right-skewed** (u shape): more data falls to the right of the mean

---

Heavy-tailed, right-skewed.

```{r} 
#| code-fold: true
set.seed(915)
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- 2 + 5 * x + rchisq(100, df = 2)
df <- data.frame(x, y)
performance::check_model(lm(y ~ x, data = df),
  check = c("normality", "qq"))
```

---

Heavy-tailed, left-skewed.

```{r} 
#| code-fold: true
set.seed(1028)
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- 2 + 5 * x + rchisq(100, df = 3) * -1
df <- data.frame(x, y)
performance::check_model(lm(y ~ x, data = df),
  check = c(c("normality", "qq")))
```

---

Light-tailed, right-skewed.

```{r} 
#| code-fold: true
set.seed(1028)
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- 2 + 5 * x + rnbinom(100, 10, .5)
df <- data.frame(x, y)
performance::check_model(lm(y ~ x, data = df),
  check = c(c("normality", "qq")))
```

## Asumption: Equal variances

```{r}
performance::check_model(fit, check = c("homogeneity", "outliers"))
```

## What is a standardised residual?

- The standardised residual is the residual divided by the standard error of the residual (normalised).

$$Standardised\ residual = \frac{Residual}{Standard\ error\ of\ the\ residual}$$
- The *mean* of the residuals is 0 in linear regression
- A standardised residual of 2 or above suggests the point is an outlier (far from the regression line)
- Spread should be random i.e. no pattern (fanning, W), which indicates **equal variances**

# Model Fit

How well does our fitted model represent the relationship between the variables?

## Hypothesis testing

How does our null ($H_0: \beta_1=0$) model compare to the linear ($H_1: \beta_1 \neq 0$) model?

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
library(dplyr)
null_model <- Galton %>%
  lm(child ~ 1, data = .) %>%
  broom::augment(Galton)
lin_model <- Galton %>%
  lm(child ~ parent, data = .) %>%
  broom::augment(Galton)
models <- bind_rows(null_model, lin_model) %>%
  mutate(model = rep(c("Null model", "SLR model"), each = nrow(Galton)))

ggplot(data = models, aes(x = parent, y = child)) +
  geom_smooth(
    data = filter(models, model == "Null model"),
    method = "lm", se = FALSE, formula = y ~ 1, size = 1
  ) +
  geom_smooth(
    data = filter(models, model == "SLR model"),
    method = "lm", se = FALSE, formula = y ~ x, size = 1
  ) +
  geom_segment(
    aes(xend = parent, yend = .fitted),
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.1, "cm")),
    size = 0.3, color = "darkgray"
  ) +
  geom_point(alpha = .2) +
  facet_wrap(~model) +
  xlab("Parent height (in)") +
  ylab("Child height (in)") +
  theme_classic()

```
::: {.fragment}
The null model is a flat line at the mean of the child height ($\bar{y}$ = `r round(mean(Galton$child))` inches).

### ANOVA Output

- `parent Sum Sq` is the variation that the `parent` variable explains in the `child` variable
- `Residuals Mean Sq` is the variation (per degree of freedom) that the model does not explain
- The `F-value` is the ratio, i.e. does `parent` explain enough variation in `child` to be considered significant?

$$\text{F-value} = \frac{\text{parent Sum Sq}}{\text{Residuals Mean Sq}} = \frac{1236.9}{5.01} = 246.84 $$

### Regression Output
We fitted a linear model (estimated using OLS) to predict child with parent (formula: child ~ parent). The model explains a statistically significant and moderate proportion of variance (R^2^ = 0.21, F(1, 926) = 246.84, p < .001). Within this model, the effect of parent is statistically significant and positive ($\beta_1$ = 0.65, 95% CI [0.57, 0.73], t(926) = 15.71, p < .001).

# Patterns
What if we want to predict from the data?

## Model fit {auto-animate="true"}

```{r}
summary(fit)$coefficients
```

Translates to:

$$\widehat{child} = 23.9 + 0.65 \cdot parent$$
- For every unit change in parent (i.e. *1 inch*), we expect a 0.65 unit change in child.
- We can predict the value of child for *any* value of parent, *but should we?*

## {auto-animate="true"}

$$\widehat{child} = 23.9 + 0.65 \cdot parent$$

```{r}
summary(fit)
```

- **Multiple R^2^**: proportion of variance in the response variable that is explained by the model.
- **Adjusted R^2^**: R^2^ adjusted for the number of predictors in the model (i.e. multiple linear regression). It only increases if the new term improves the model more than would be expected by chance
    - *Always lower than multiple R^2^*
    - Can use this to interpret simple linear regression **to compare with a multiple linear regression model**

<!-- It is a measure of how far the data points are from the fitted line. -->

## Making predictions

What is the predicted child height for a parent height of 70 inches?

Since:

$$\widehat{child} = 23.9 + 0.65 \cdot parent$$

Then:

```{r}
#| echo: true
child <- 23.9 + 0.65 * 70
child
```

We use `predict()` to make predictions -- it takes in the `lm()` model and understands the equation.

```{r}
predict(fit, data.frame(parent = 70)) # using 70 as this is the value we want to sub in and predict

```

:::{.callout-note}
How good is our *prediction* actually? Is it accurate? We cover this in Week 9.

# Transformations

What if assumptions are not met, or we want to improve the model?

## What if assumptions are not met?

### Violations of...

- **Linearity** can cause systematically wrong predictions
- **Homoskedasticity** makes it difficult to estimate "true" standard deviation of errors (i.e. noisy estimates)
- **Normality** can compromise inferences and hypothesis testing


## How do we solve these problems?

- Use less restrictive (but more complicated) models, e.g. generalised linear models, non-parametric techniques (ENVX3002)
- Perform variance corrections (complicated)
- [**Transform the response variable ($y$)** to stabilise variance and correct normality]{style="color: seagreen"}
- [**Transform the predictor variable ($x$)** if issues still exist in the diagnostics]{style="color: seagreen"}

:::{.callout-note}
We can also perform transformations to improve the model fit, but **beware of overfitting** -- we want to make reasonable predictions, not fit the data!

## New example: Air quality

Daily air quality measurements in New York, May to September 1973.

```{r}
str(airquality)
```

## Is Ozone concentration influenced by Temperature?

```{r}
ggplot(airquality, aes(x = Temp, y = Ozone)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .2, size = 3) +
  labs(
    x = expression("Temperature " ( degree~C)), 
    y = "Ozone (parts per billion)") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

## Assumption checks

```{r}
fit <- lm(Ozone ~ Temp, data = airquality)
performance::check_model(fit, check = c("linearity", "qq", "homogeneity", "outliers")) # check specific assumptions
```

Is a simple linear model appropriate? *Depends on your threshold for what is acceptable.*

## The log transform

:::{.fragment}
- Log-linear: $Log(Y)=\beta_0+\beta_1x$
  - An increase of $x$ by 1 unit corresponds to a $\beta_1$ unit increase in $log(Y)$
  - An increase of $x$ by 1 unit corresponds to a $\beta_1 \times 100\%$ increase in $Y$
:::
:::{.fragment}
- Linear-log: $Y=\beta_0+\beta_1log(x)$
  - An increase of $1\%$ in $x$ corresponds to a $\frac{\beta_1}{100}$ increase in $Y$
:::
:::{.fragment}
- Log-log: $Log(Y)=\beta_0+\beta_1log(x)$
  - An increase of $1\%$ in $x$ corresponds to a $\beta_1\%$ increase in $Y$
:::

## Backtransforming -- FYI

A log transformation (natural or a base) is relatively easy to back-transform.

$$\widehat{log(Ozone)}=\color{royalblue}{-1.8380 + 0.0675 \times Temp}$$
$$\widehat{Ozone}=e^{-1.8380 + 0.0675 \times Temp}=e^{-1.8380} \times e^{0.0675 \times Temp}$$
But given we are focused on a 1-unit change of `Temp`, $\widehat{Ozone}$ changes by $e^{0.0675} = 1.07$ times.

If this had been a `sqrt()` transformation...

$$\widehat{\sqrt{Ozone}}=-1.8380 + 0.0675 \times Temp$$
$$\widehat{Ozone}=(-1.8380 + 0.0675 \times Temp)^2 = 3.3782−(0.2481×Temp)+(0.0675×Temp)^2$$

## Percent change with $ln$ transformation -- FYI

Interpreting as a percent change can be more meaningful - it can be done with any log transformation (substitute $e$ below for 10 or any other base), but the **quick approximation only works with natural log transformations**. 

If $y$ has been transformed with a natural log (`log(y)`), for a one-unit increase in $x$ the **percent change in $y$** (not `log(y)`) is calculated with:

$$\Delta y \% = 100 \cdot (e^{\beta_1}-1)$$

If $\beta_1$ is small (i.e. $-0.25 < \beta_1 < 0.25$), then: $e^{\beta_1} \approx 1 + \beta_1$. So $\Delta y \% \approx 100 \cdot \beta_1$.

The transformed model model equation is: 

$$\widehat{log(Ozone)}=\color{royalblue}{-1.8380 + 0.0675 \times Temp}$$
A 1 degree (&deg;F) increase in temperature is associated with a:

- 0.0675 increase in `log(Ozone)` concentration
- $e^{0.0675} = 1.07$ *times* increase in `Ozone` concentration
- Approximately a 6.75% increase in `Ozone` concentration

# Multiple linear regression

### The MLR model

$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + ... + \beta_kx_k + \epsilon$$

where

- a response variable ($Y$) which we wish to predict using predictor variables ($x_k$)
- $\beta_0$ is the y-intercept
- $\beta_k$ is the partial regression coefficient associated with the $k^{th}$ predictor variable
- $\epsilon$ is error and $\epsilon \sim N(0,\ \sigma^2)$

## Can we use more predictors? {auto-animate=true}

```{r}
psych::pairs.panels(airquality)
```

Can we improve the current model by adding *wind* and *solar radiation* as additional predictors?

## Can we use more predictors? {auto-animate=true}

### From:

$$log(size)_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1Temp_i + \epsilon_i$$

### To:

$$log(size)_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1Temp_i + \color{royalblue}{\beta_2Solar.R_i + \beta_3Wind_i} + \epsilon_i$$

## Can we use more predictors? {auto-animate=true}

$$log(size)_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1Temp_i + \color{royalblue}{\beta_2Solar.R_i + \beta_3Wind_i} + \epsilon_i$$

```{r}
#| eval: true
multi_fit <- lm(log(Ozone) ~ Temp + Solar.R + Wind, data = airquality)
```

## Assumptions

```{r}
performance::check_model(multi_fit, check = c("linearity", "qq", "homogeneity", "outliers")) # check specific assumptions
```

## Hypothesis

## Model Fit {auto-animate=true}

```{r}
summary(multi_fit)
```

<br>

Model equation:

$$\widehat{log(Ozone)}=-0.262 + 0.0492 \cdot Temp + 0.00252 \cdot Solar.R - 0.0616 \cdot Wind$$

## Interpretation {auto-animate=true}

$$\widehat{log(Ozone)}=-0.262 + 0.0492 \cdot Temp + 0.00252 \cdot Solar.R - 0.0616 \cdot Wind$$

**Holding all other variables constant:**

- A one degree (&deg;F) increase in `Temp` is associated with a 4.9% increase in `Ozone` concentration.
- A one unit increase in `Solar.R` is associated with a 0.25% increase in `Ozone` concentration.
- A one unit increase in `Wind` is associated with a 6.2% decrease in `Ozone` concentration.

Automating extracting the model equation into latex using `extract_eq()` from the package `equatiomatic`:

```{r}
#| echo: true
equatiomatic::extract_eq(multi_fit, use_coefs = TRUE, coef_digits = 3) |> print()
```

## Is MLR model better?

```{r}
#| echo: true
sjPlot::tab_model(fit_log, multi_fit, digits = 4, show.ci = FALSE)
```

- The adjusted $R^2$ is higher for the MLR model...
- Interpretation of $R^2$ is the same as for simple linear regression: how much of the variation in the response variable is explained by the model
- **Are all the variables/predictors needed?**

# Summing up
