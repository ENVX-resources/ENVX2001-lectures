## Structure

### Lectures

**Tue 10 AM, Wed 11 AM** -- [Chemistry Lecture Theatre 3][clt03]

### Tutorials

**Self-guided** sessions (1 hour), to be completed before the week's lab.

### Labs

All labs are held in the **South Eveleigh Precinct** (more on this later):

- Thursday 9 am – 12 pm
- Friday 10 am – 1 pm, 2 pm – 5 pm

## Attendance

- Mandatory for labs, **80%** minimum required.
- Lecture attendance is highly recommended, but not compulsory.
- Lecture recordings capture slides and audio *only*. You will miss out on important discussions and informal feedback.

# South Eveleigh Precinct
Used to be known as the **Australian Techonlogy Park** (ATP). *Still is, but it used to, too.*

## Directions


### Buses
[Courtesy buses][buses] are available:

- Best option is to take the bus from **Fisher Library** to **Redfern Station**, then walk to the precinct (through the new station platform as “local traffic”).
- Alternatively, direct buses are available -- but less frequent.

### Driving
Free parking is available around Henderson Road, but it is extremely crowded. We do *not* recommend driving to the precinct.

# Why study statistics?

*Why would it be relevant to my (non-statistical) career?*


##  Importance
All of science (and industry) are increasingly data-driven and computational:

- **Research** papers are filled with statistical analyses
- **Business** and **policy** decisions are based on data analytics
- Environmental **policies** are guided by statistical models
- **Medical** treatments are evaluated using statistical methods

Most of you are majoring in a field that will require you to understand and use statistics in some form.

## Benefits

Even if you don't become a data scientist, statistics will help you to:

1. **Evaluate claims critically**
   - Understand and analyse data in your field
   - Make informed decisions based on evidence

2. **Communicate effectively**
   - Create compelling data visualisations and reports
   - Present findings clearly to different audiences

3. **Solve real-world problems**
   - Design and analyse experiments properly
   - Make evidence-based predictions and identify trends

# Doing well

Attend lectures | Put in the hours | Ask questions

## Lecture attendance options
### In-person vs. online recordings

::: fragment
**In-person benefits:**

- Real-time interaction with peers and lecturers
- Immediate feedback and clarification of concepts
- Active participation in discussions and polls
- Building connections with classmates

**Online recording benefits:**

- Flexibility to manage other commitments
- Ability to pause and review complex concepts
- Learn at your own pace
- Convenient for those with long commutes
:::

## On-campus or online?

Choose the option that best suits your learning style and circumstances. **If watching online, try to**:

- Stay up to date with recordings to avoid falling behind
- Use Ed discussion board actively for questions
- **Attend some lectures in person when possible for key topics**

There is a strong positive correlation between lecture attendance and final grades -- but it's not the only factor. *It may just be the case that students who attend lectures are more likely to keep up with the course material.*

## Put in the hours 
- This is a **6 credit point** unit, which means that you are expected to spend **120 -- 150 hours** in total, including exam prep time (~10 h per week)!
- **Practice makes perfect**. Tutorials and Labs help you apply the concepts you learn in lectures -- complete all the exercises, and practice with the bonus questions provided.

## Ask questions

- [**Ed**][edsite] is the *best* place to ask questions. We are way more responsive on **Ed** than on email.
- We are *open* to the use of AI tools (including LLMs like ChatGPT) to help you answer questions about code... but don't use them to cheat *yourself* out of learning.
- We have **drop-in sessions**, where you can jump in and have a chat on Zoom. We will announce the schedule on **Ed**.

# Learning outcomes

## By the end of this course, we want you to be able to:
- **LO1** demonstrate proficiency in designing sample schemes and analysing data from them **using R**.
- **LO2** describe and identify the basic features of an **experimental design**: replicate, treatment structure and blocking structure.
- **LO3** demonstrate proficiency in the use or the statistical programming language **R** to apply an ANOVA and fit regression models to experimental data.
- **LO4** demonstrate proficiency in the use or the statistical programming language **R** to use multivariate methods to find patterns in data.
- **LO5** interpret the output and understand conceptually how its derived of a regression, ANOVA and multivariate analysis that have been calculated by R.
- **LO6** write statistical and modelling results as part of a scientific report.
- **LO7** appraise the validity of statistical analyses used publications.
